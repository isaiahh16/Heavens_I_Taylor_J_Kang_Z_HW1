		<p> Hi! Iʼm Josh Taylor.
Iʼve graduated from fanshawe in St. Thomas in 2016 with a certificate in
mechanical techniques for CNC. I still live in St. Thomas and drive in every day. My
hobbies include painting miniatures, gardening, video games, and walking my dog.
Last book I read was Jordan Petersons “12 rules for life: An antidote to chaos” and
Iʼm currently reading through H.P. Lovecrafts collection. Recently Iʼve grown
Carolina reaper and ghost peppers and theyʼre currently fermenting to be made
into hot sauce soon.
Iʼve worked through Fanshawe and STEAM education centre as a 3D designer on
commission for multiple companies. I hope to secure a career in 3D design after
graduating again.</p>

		<p>Hello, my name is Isaiah. I was born in Washington, USA and moved to London, Ontario where I was raised since I was 2 years old. I Decided to take interactive media design hoping to gain skills in website development and have a future career involving it.

		<p>I am Zepeng Kang, you can call me Felix for easier. Originally from China, living in Canada as international student. This is my first year in interactive media and my first time learning something related coding. I was in Pre-Media last year in main campus and it was about taking photos with DSLR, edit audio using Logic, and learned some fundamental stuff of photoshop, premier and after effect. Before that, I was in Business Finance, but it didn’t end up well. In the spare time, I like to play video games, mostly computer games, I do enjoy playing competitive games than single player game cause I like to play with my friends. But if the game is really good such as Metal Gear, I will play it. My life is boring to others maybe, there are pretty much nothing I would do other than gaming, studying and sleeping.</p>
