		<p> Hi! I’m Josh Taylor.

I’ve graduated from fanshawe in St. Thomas in 2016 with a certificate in mechanical techniques for CNC. I still live in St. Thomas and drive in every day. My hobbies include painting miniatures, gardening, video games, and walking my dog. Last book I read was Jordan Petersons “12 rules for life: An antidote to chaos” and I’m currently reading through H.P. Lovecrafts collection. Recently I’ve grown Carolina reaper and ghost peppers and they’re currently fermenting to be made into hot sauce soon.

I’ve worked through Fanshawe and STEAM education centre as a 3D designer on commission for multiple companies. I hope to secure a career in 3D design after graduating again.</p>
